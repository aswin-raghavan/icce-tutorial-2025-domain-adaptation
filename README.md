# ICCE Tutorial 2025 on "A3: Domain Adaptation at the Edge using Hyperdimensional Computing"

## Abstract
This hands-on tutorial will focus on a central challenge in deploying AI models to edge or consumer devices. Domain adaptation involves taking an off-the-shelf model and adapting it to make the model precise in a specific domain context (e.g., a specific user). Domain adaptation is challenging on consumer edge devices and when the target domain is different from the domains covered in offline pre-training. Hyperdimensional Computing is an edge friendly method that is well-suited for this task. The tutorial will delve into Hyperdimensional Computing as a way to perform domain adaptation at the edge. The applications will range from few shot learning, to multi-modal processing for visual grounding, to retrieval augmented generation (RAG). A basic understanding of machine learning terminology is useful but not required.
